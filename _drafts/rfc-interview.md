At one my job, I had the opportunity to run some experiments with our hiring process. One of the experiments involved trying to design an interview question testing the mentorship skills of the candidate.

We were looking for a tech lead for one of our team. One of the duty of this person would be to mentor more junior member of  the team. How can we test this during a 50min interview?

In our case, we asked the candidates to review a pull request. 


Our intro was the following: 

> At $COMPANY_NAME$ we ask people to write a small design doc before starting to work on new projects. This document gets reviewed by the different leads and manager before the work can starts. We see it as a great way to mentor each others.. In this case, a junior engineer has been tasked to work on a new project that might require a new piece of infrastructure. He wrote a design document and is asking you to review it. What would you say? Please keep in mind this is a junior developer asking for feedback from a senior member of our team.


We provided the candidates with a laptop connected to a private Github repository with a "real" pull request waiting to be reviewed. One of our expectation was for the candidate to actually left comments on the PR, or to 


The content of the PR was 100% made-up and designed in a way that plenty of talking points existed.



What we observed:
- people did not know how to make a code review at all. Very strange coming with previous title of senior dev/ops / SRE
- focus on weird technical things
- lack of interest for the  business or the context of the change
-
