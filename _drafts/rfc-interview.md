At Hipmunk, we are creating RFC documents before big modifications of our application. These documents help us improve communication between teams, clarify requirements and foster collaboration. Each describe the motivation for the change, different solutions and a timeline for the implementation. They get publicly review by the team using Github.

As an experiment, we asked some of the people we interviewed to review an RFC we creeated for the occasion.

As an engineering manager, you are looking to hire people with skills that your team need/lack. You then need to "construct" an interview process that will test those in the candidate you are evaluating.
