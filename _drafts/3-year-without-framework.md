Article bashing ember, angular, boilerplate everywhere
3 + year, no major framework in our stack

advantage: we know how it is working, it is doing what we need it to do
problem: lack do documentation, which make onboarding harder, nobody
else is mainting it, loose the community part of it, can be harder to
hire


technology and tool are made to solve problem. loving tools to love
tools is silly

most of these framework are still too immature
