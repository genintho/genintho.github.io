When you work for Expensify, you know that October is [offshore season](http://we.are.expensify.com/offshoring/).
This year, we are going to Cambodia and Thailand. But before that, I have spent a few days in Myanmar.

## Accuracy of information about Myanmar

Myanmar has been kind of closed to tourism for a long time and is now opening up. It is not possible to go freely 
everywhere, but the open areas are big enough with enough to see to justify a trip.

Because of that, Myanmar is still "untouched" by mass tourism and so is now a trendy destination with a number of tourists 
growing quickly every year. This influx of foreign money and the recent government change are transforming the country.
 When looking for information on the Internet, please make sure you are reading a recent article. 
 
So as of September 2015, ATMs are everywhere in Yangon, Bagan and Mandalay. All of our hotels/hostels/Inns had Wifi with no 
visible restrictions. We got SIM cards with data and they worked almost everywhere, like if we were in the US.
 
## The trip

My trip ended up looking like this

1. Flying to Yangon
2. Spending 2 days in Yangon
3. Taking a night bus from Yangon to Bagan
4. 3 days in Bagan
5. Boat from Bagan to Mandalay
6. One day in Mandalay
7. Flying out of Mandalay

That's definitely a short time, and I wish I could spend more time discovering Myanmar. But enough to see some amazing
things and build the need to come back to see more.
