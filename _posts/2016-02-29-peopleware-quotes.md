#### Chapter 6

__This Is Management__

> The manager's function is not to make people work, but to make it possible for people to work.

#### Chapter 7

__The uniform plastic basement__

> As long as workers are crowded into noisy, strerile, disruptive space,
it's not worth improving anything but the workspace


#### Chapter 8

__You never get anything done around here between 9 and 5__

> The amazing thing is not that it's often imporssible to work in the 
workplace; the amazing thing is that everyone knows it and nobody ever
does anything about it.

#### Chapter 10

__Time accounting based on flow__

> An hour in flow really accomplishes something, but ten six-minute work
periods sandwiched between eleven interruptions won't accomplish
anything.
