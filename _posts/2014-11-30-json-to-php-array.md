title: Converting JSON into PHP array

When you are building integration with what ever JSNO API, you often need to mock the API response. You can do it to juste code, write tests, very some conditions, etc.

And sometimes, it is easier/more convenient to use an other format than a JSON store in a file or a string.

As my main backend langage is PHP, I wrote this small tool to convert a JSON into a PHP array 

[http://genintho.github.io/json-to-php-array/](http://genintho.github.io/json-to-php-array/)

It is simple and minimalist.

Pull request welcome
