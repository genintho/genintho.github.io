PaperSpider is the idea of a project I had in the back of my mind for a very long time. Every time you need to do a task involving a lot of different documents, it is just a giant pain. Some documents are on paper, some are in your email account(s?), others are behind some accounts, on some folder, etc.
It is a disaster, you could not believe.

One obvious solution is to copy stuff on your laptop and organized the document in a folder system with naming conventions. It works. But I am lazy, and I would like something a bit more automated, importing, classifying, indexing and archiving the documents for me with very little interaction from my part.

That's for the MVP. Many more additional extensions can be imagined to simplify our digital life from sharing document, with a lawyer for example, to documents checklist helping application to different things.

I kept grumbling about this first world problem with my friends and to myself with each new tax season or visa application. One day, Mike reached a tipping point where he saw himself be helped by such a tools. And that was it. We were going to build PaperSpider.

We are perfectly aware that this tool will be useful to a minority. But we are seeing this as an opportinity to learn and keep working together. We want to build it like it is 2005, trying to experiment with the UI/UX and be opinionated, even if it will not please everybody.

PaperSpider is not even close to be lunch, even in beta, but you can already access some it at [https://www.paperspider.io/](https://paperspider.io/).
Updates, will be found here.
